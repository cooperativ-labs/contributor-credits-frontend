Cooperativs are projects looking for collaborators. Sometimes they are early-stage businesses. Sometimes
they are just for fun. They rarely have cash to pay for work, but our
[Cooperative Contracts](/contracts) make it easy to share of the Cooperativ's future success. If one
interests you, click "Join."

### Here is how it works: 
1. Create a project and invite any co-founders to join.
2. Establish one of our Cooperativ Contracts. 
3. Use the project profile to recruit more contributors from existing networks like Reddit, Indiehackers, or that cool game-dev Discord you joined a few months ago.
4. Pay these contributors with Contributor Credits. This gives them them a stake in the success of the project without complicating your future capitalization table or giving them open-ended revenue-share.

### Coming soon: 
* Simple legal agreements for adding co-creators and contributors to your Cooperativ
* Revenue sharing smart contract
* Contributor Credits for revenue-based businesses
