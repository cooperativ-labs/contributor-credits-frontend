## Questions about Project Profiles
### Do I have to have a business?
No! (but you can if you want to) Anyone can create a project and invite collaborators. When you create an invitation, you configure it with some rights and responsibilities for the person you are inviting. Maybe you permit them to use their work for the project in their portfolio, and perhaps you agree to make the project open source if you choose to give up on it yourself. You can also set the terms of ownership and compensation. You "sign" the invitation when you send it, and the collaborator "signs" it when they accept it.

### What if I already have a business and want it to own the project?
It often makes a lot of sense for a legal business entity to own a project. Perhaps your project has become so successful that you want to accept investment, or you need to rent office space or open a bank account. In these cases, you will want to transfer your ownership of the project to the business.

It is really easy to have your business own a project, you just include your Tax ID number or Employer Identification Number (EIN) and attest that you are authorized to make decisions on behalf of the company.

### What if I don't want to run my project anymore?
You have a few options, though they may be limited by your agreements with collaborators. You can shut down the project entirely if you want, but you can also transfer ownership to someone else or make the project open-source. Obligations to collaborators typically stay with the project, so the new owner, if there is one, will become responsible for those.

## Questions about Contributor Credits
### What happens if the project never reaches the trigger?
The contributor always takes the risk that the company won't reach the trigger and the C² won't reach their full value. However, project owners can pay C² alongside cash, which the contributor keeps no matter what happens.

It's also possible for the entrepreneur to "partially fund" any outstanding C² that haven't yet reached their trigger. For example, say the trigger for a set of C² is $1,000,000 in investment, but the company raises only $500,000. The project owner could choose to fund the outstanding C² at 50% (or more, or less) as a show of goodwill towards her contributors. Contributors who want the money right away can cash in their C² for half their face value. Other contributors can choose not to cash in their C², but rather to wait until the company raises another round and reaches the trigger.

### What happens to my C² if Sunshine Labs goes out of business?
Contributor Credits are created and funded using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It's those smart contracts that record the terms of the relationship and hold the money that has been paid. Because Ethereum is public and decentralized, there isn't any way that anyone anywhere could erase the smart contracts. Even if Sunshine goes out of business, the money that has been paid will be safe, the terms of the contract will still be valid, and entrepreneurs will have to pay when they hit the triggers they have set.

### Do I pay or earn cryptocurrency?
The simple answer is no. In order to fund the C², you buy a "stablecoin" - [usually USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) - using regular money. USDC's value is pegged to the dollar. As a contributor to a project, you cash in the C² you have earned and receive USDC, which you can then easily exchange for regular money. The more complicated answer is that you can also use non-stablecoin cryptocurrency, if you want to, because the smart contract doesn't care what you fund it with.

### I am a nerd. Tell me how this really works.
Each class of C² is composed of an Ethereum smart contract. The smart contract produces an ERC-20 token that includes the relevant trigger terms. This token is a C², and the holder can cash it in at any time by transferring it back to the smart contract. Doing so releases to the C² holder an amount of cash proportional to the amount the C² creator has funded them. For example, if I payed you C²1000, and funded them 10%, you could cash in those C² for a total of $100.
