You want to start a business - lets say its an indy game-dev company - with someone you met on Reddit. You don't want to waste time setting up a legal entity, and even if you did, this co-founder's country doesn't enforce contracts.

**Here is what you do:**

1. Create a project on [Cooperativ.io](http://cooperativ.io/) and invite your new co-founder to join.
2. Establish one of our blockchain-based "Microbusinesses" and allocate revenue share.
3. Use the project profile to recruit more contributors from existing networks like Reddit, Indiehackers, or that cool game-dev Discord you joined a few months ago.
4. Pay these contributors our "Contributor Credits" for their hard work. This gives them them a stake in the success of the project without complicating your future cap table or giving them open-ended revenue-share

**No borders, no contracts, no lawyers, no relying on trust, complete transparency. All set up in about twenty minutes.**

That's what Sunshine Labs is building.
