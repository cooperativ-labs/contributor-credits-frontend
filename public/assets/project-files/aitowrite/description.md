The vision is to build a general purpose AI-powered writing tool that helps users write better text. In the next three years, the goal is to become the de-facto tool for writing technical documentation. Cautiously considering expanding to other markets like writing blogs, novels, marketing copy, essays, whitepapers, and so on.

**PROBLEM**:
Companies often do not have dedicated technical writers. It's hard to write well-structured sentences and documents. It's also time consuming to build and maintain a documentation site.

**SOLUTION**:
AI to Write is a web-based UI that offers a streamlined workflow to write, review, and publish docs. It also offers writing tips, writing analytics, and autocomplete suggestions to help you and your team write better.

I am currently building "Writing Tips" feature that will be built using the TEASPN + GPT-3 framework (you can see a demo at [the TEASPN website](https://www.teaspn.org/demo)).

**Possible features include:**
- grammatical error correction
- auto completion
- text rewriting
- external resource searching
- syntax highlighting
- word definitions.
- validate for active voice and present tense.
- integrate with an SEO tool for document-level tips.
- toggle for English US and UK.
