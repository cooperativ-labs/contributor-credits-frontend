VisitMind is an educational website to host tools and resources for college students. It focuses on helping them find the academic material that fits their needs, so that they can spend less time searching and more time learning. Visitmind hosts tools and resources that are aligned to help the students develop skills and knowledge that they can apply in both their college and professional lives.

We provide these services through a website where creators can offer the most useful learning tools and resources. Students will have access to a general explanation about how to use the material, as well as information about its benefits and disadvantages. We are adding a "gamification" layer to help service the best content. Students can write and read reviews about the materials, gain points for every review that they write, and redeem these points for benefits. In this way, we are creating a community of students who share knowledge and experience.
