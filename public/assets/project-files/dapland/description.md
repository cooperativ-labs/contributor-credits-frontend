I am building an app where players challenge each other online and fans showcase players' skills. Everyone can be recognized by the community and get respect with specific basketball rewards.

Everything is like real basketball. Players can make shots, fans can make assists which helps players to make a shot. Users can record videos and make live streams.

There are no traditional likes. Basketball lovers use hand shakes or just shakes to show respect to each other. There is a timeline and video user reactions, called "hooting," which users can use to support players. Highly respected skills are honored with B badges (schooled, posterized, beast mode).

Top players and fans get into The Hall of Fame of courts, cities, countries and worldwide.
