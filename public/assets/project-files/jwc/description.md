**Our Mission:** To help writers explore their creative obsessions, discuss all roads that our muses take us on, reflect upon works that meander in the mind, and share the writings that our busy schedules have allowed to develop.",

We do this through a range of activities. 

1. **Creative Workshopping:** When we read aloud to other creative thinkers, we learn confidence, courage, and practice presenting as if before potential publishers. This is done without "constructive criticism" but rather with encouragement and ina round table where positive feedback inspires. In other words, we share our impressions, and by drawing from our experience of the text, we compare how a fellow workshop member would write it if it were his or her own. 
2. **Adaptive Bookcraft:** Adaptive bookcraft is important to publishing. With oversight and assessment, we help writers identify the medium that best highlights their talents (novels, poetry, scripts, etc.). Once a talent outlet is established, we discuss a project's form and explore its target audience.
