No one wants to do gardening, cleaning or other work around the house, but right now there are only two possibilities: 

1. Do it yourself
2. Hire a company

Most companies deliberately refuse small jobs or set hourly rates far too high. The small private customers have no other option than to maintain the house themselves. When they do hire a company, the hourly prices are extremely high, they often must schedule walk-through appointments, and the actual work doesn't start for weeks or even months.

**Gardream solves this problem.**

For customers, we offer a platform on which they can book home & garden services, online, within ten minutes. No long phone calls, no visit appointments, no uncertain hourly prices. With our website and the automatic quote system, every customer can book services for any property in Germany, independent of location. No hourly prices, just fixed prices the size of area and the type of work. 

The work is performed by working students, who can easily find jobs to match their schedules. This marketplace approach wil lets us develop from a local service business to a scalable, national, and customer-oriented business model, where the customer saves time and money, and the working student is able to earn a flexible side income.
