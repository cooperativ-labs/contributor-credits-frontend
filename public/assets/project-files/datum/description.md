Datum is a multi-platform software designed to make data collection on your personal life extremely easy and as fast as possible. Collecting data on your life reveals incredible insights into how you spend your time, and also builds an understanding of your life that intuition alone cannot offer. I personally use Datum to collect over 50 streams of data in my life and it given me a zen like appreciation for how I live my life. By making data collection and analysis very easy it enables people to draw conclusions and understand their lives better and gives them more power in their lives.
