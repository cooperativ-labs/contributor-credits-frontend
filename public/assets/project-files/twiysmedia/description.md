Imagine a music entertainment series developed solely to inspire artists toward a higher code of conduct within the music industry. 

The World Is Your Stage, or TWIYS Media, centers around eight contestants and the human and moral challenges they face, not simply their talent and charisma. Although TWIYS Media is concerned about its artists ability to move a crowd, we are equally concerned about their values and ethics on the road to stardom. 

To properly vet and inspire our hopefuls, we have pre-arranged challenges-in-disguise, which arise while filming each episode. Each artist, unaware, addresses the challenges differently based on their individual values and morality because, lets face it, we are not all built the same. 

Behind the scenes, a star studded panel of judges begin an inspiring dialogue about why certain ethics played an important role in helping them navigate the music industry. The fans get a glimpse of what it really takes to ascend to higher prominence within the landscape of pop culture. 

To even further engage, we invite our viewers to participate in the voting process, which allows them to weigh in on each contestants challenge day-to-day or week-to-week. Reimagining what it truly means to be a star in todays industry, while gamifying the participation not only makes for engaging content, it also changes the narrative within our culture. We are TWIYS, and  we invite you to join us as we change the game!
