As of now only a tiny percentage of companies make use of blockchain technology. Part of the problem is that the ecosystem is not prime time ready - tools commonly available in regular software development (or currently being developed for the AI/ML space) is completely are no where to be found in the blockchain space.

DSafe is currently working on an SDK that allows analyzing, storing and cataloging of smart contract events. Once the core is built, there are multiple options what to attach to the core SDK. Currently the plan is to add a CLI to comfortably use the SDK and add some nice plots / basic algorithms (e.g. outlier detection). This should compose the current MVP that allows to raise money to turn this into a proper SaaS.

As a B2B business DSafe plans to form (unpaid) partnerships with companies that use Smart Contracts as early as possible. This will allow to develop the product around the customer needs and integrate it into a core service platform with time.
