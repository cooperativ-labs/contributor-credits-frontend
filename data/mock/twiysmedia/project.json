So if you need someone to micro-manage, I've been one for as long as I can remember because I have bossy-boot qualities. I am an excellent writer and writing is something I really enjoy. I love talking to and meeting interesting people I can be extremely persuasive and convincing. So my role could be marketing, sales, copywriting, networking and/or micro-management.",
