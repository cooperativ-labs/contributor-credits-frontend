    "problem":
      "Although technological opportunities are at it's highest for writers we haven't yet leveraged the full organizational possibilities to efficiently utilize this advantage. There is a decreased equitable opportunity for independent writers as today's publishing conglomerates corner the market share in modern day digital media distribution and customer acquisition.",

      "To help writers explore their creative obsessions, discuss all roads that our muses take us on, reflect upon works that meander in the mind, and share the writings that our busy schedules have allowed to develop.",
    "vision": "To empower writers to pursue their creativity equitably.",

        "Richard Andrew Olkusz, ‚ÄúRicky‚Äù to his friends and family, is on a life mission - to perfect his words and bring poetic dimension to a secondary world. The diverse experiences that accompanied his eighteen-year surveying career profoundly shaped his life. The daily measuring of real estate and construction properties fueled his love of poetic description, humorous anecdotes, spiritualism, and paranormal investigation. Ricky and his business partner, Dave, ran Olkwood publishing since 2007, where they developed rules for a tabletop R.P.G. and created Afternity. Ricky works from home drafting maps using AutoCAD, he continues to write novels, poetry, and short stories, which have yielded nearly a million words of fiction overall. Ricky supports the pursuit of creative obsessions by hosting Joe‚Äôs Writers Club Podcast, an affiliation of Joe‚Äôs Writers Club, LLC, and by contributing his fictional works to its Corporate Gothic anthology, a selection of short stories set in haunted work spaces.",
