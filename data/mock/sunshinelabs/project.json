    "shortDescription": "Making it possible to set up a business, across borders, without awkward equity conversations, in 15 minutes. Builders of Cooperativ.",
    "needSummary": "Someone who really ",
    "elevatorPitch": "Sunshine Labs is building a set of tools that help entrepreneurs with early-stage projects find, onboard, and compensate collaborators without cash while protecting IP. We plan to replace incorporation with a new kind of digital entity.",
    "problem": "Starting a business is too hard. There is currently no structured way to collaborate and share value without forming a legal business entity, which is expensive, time-consuming, intimidating, and forces the entrepreneur to make a bunch of decisions she may not be ready to make.",
    "mission": "Sunshine Labs will make it possible for anyone anywhere to work with collaborators to quickly start and grow a business.",
    "vision": "Starting a business should be much easier. There should be no incorporation, no attorneys, no awkward equity conversations, no invoicing, no contracts. You should be able to come up with an idea, invite people to your team, and start building.",
    "timeGoals": {
      "now": "We have an alpha running for the blockchain-based 'Contributor Credits' product, and we are preparing to role out a production version of the rest of the platform. We have ten groups who have agreed to add their projects to the platform at launch.",
      "oneYear": "Our target for 1 Jan 2022 is to have at least 300 projects live on the platform with at least 1000 total collaborators. We also expect to expand the types of contracts built into the system and to offer tokenized equity options.",
      "threeYears": "By 1 Jan 2024 we hope that our platform will be considered the standard way to start, organize, and govern a business. We expect many projects to be collectively owned and to be experimenting with new ways of sharing control."
